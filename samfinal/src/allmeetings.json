So we have to look on this. First of all methodology they made methodology to find out the trend was in Kruger was done in a way we have done it is not only research remote control Market survey, but we also considered the latest fashion trends of the market because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit. So what are our findings in our findings? We have seen that when we did our remote-control Market survey, we found that people people do have preference for those fancy mobile for remote controls which look and feel very good rather than having a functional look and feel good. So this this clearly indicates their preference for the design their Outlook of the remote. Rolls, so we should take into we should consider this Factor as the most important factor because this factor is twice as important the second factor, which is further the twice the as important as the second the third Factor. So this Factor becomes the most important factor in our server in our mark means intake and designing our remote controls. The last one is most important one. No, the first one is the the Outlook of the mobile the it should have a fancy Outlook the fancy design rather than just having a functional look and feel good. It should have a fancy look and feel good. This second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically Innovative. We must have some technological advancement in the remote control the rather than just putting it as it is as the other remote controls are so it should be technologically innovative. Native like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition or something like that. So that indicates our technological advancement and The third most important aspect in this to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use like it shouldn't be too much complicated there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobile remote control. It shouldn't be too complicated and like this way and it should be and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language something so that they would know how to use this remote controls. When we did Fashions recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that sorry. Yeah. Yeah, we have to because you can see how people have related the clothes shoes and Furniture everything with fruits and vegetables. So sick world is now changing its Trend towards organic becoming more and more. Organic is having big sponge lemon. Yeah, so that's yeah, I get it. So something like that we should do and people the feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic. Look hard. Look. Well. That's good. That's yeah. Yeah predict so so that they could play with it while handy while handling it. Okay, so that should also be taken into Consideration. So these are my views. Okay the spongy not real spongy you can it can think like rubber would be good or does it really want delivered which is good for health and which is quite disposable. Okay that we can take it. Yeah. It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also because our company is very well adapted for taking all these concerns into consideration. So we don't want to have any harm to the society Okay, so",

I'll give you the I guess technical considerations for those. I don't use a whiteboard just because we haven't used it. Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing, right? So the wagon do this is we're going to take a look at some old remote controls see how they work reuse the final kind of essential pieces of it and then we'll throw in our new Innovations. Keep it all in budget. So magic man looking inside a very simple remote control. This is what they sent me. Okay, here's the competition. I suppose you open it up. There's a circuit board inside. And there's a chip processor at the TA one 1835 which receives input from the buttons. This is a standard off-the-shelf kind of a chip. Is it right? It's very very cheap amount. This is the amount of cost nothing. Yeah. So that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the the amplifier which is made of some transistors and amplifiers op amps. Then that gets sent to the LED light which I can kind of see that little red light bulb the end and that sends out the infrared light signal to the television perilous. So this is kind of the Bare Essentials that we need to have in a remote control. It defines. So can we make them to pretty much any size we like her is there a minimum or not? I mean, this is a very old one. So now with the new technology this is I'm going to be a minimum really small and keep almost a keyring, right? So this is what we need to have for certain. So he has to say we got the outer casing but you have to decide you know, what's going to be the board we have to use basically the same setup processor will probably use a more advanced processor with my had amplifying transmitter all standard. So for the casing this email I got from our manufacturing team, you know, we have a bunch of options from would tie. Titanium rubber plastic but not latex double curve curve. So lots of choices.
